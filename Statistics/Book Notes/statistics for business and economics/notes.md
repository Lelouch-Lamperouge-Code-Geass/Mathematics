# Chapter 01 Data and Statistics

Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data. Nearly every college student majoring in business or economics is required to take a course in statistics.

### Scales of Measurement

Data collection requires one of the following scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. The scale of measurement determines the amount of information contained in the data and indicates the most appropriate data summarization and statistical analyses.

When the data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify an attribute of the element, the scale of measurement is considered a __nominal scale__. The scale of measurement for a variable is called an __ordinal scale__ if the data exhibit the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. The scale of measurement for a variable is an __interval scale__ if the data have all the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Interval data are always numeric. Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores are an example of interval-scaled data. For example, three students with SAT math scores of 620, 550, and 470 can be ranked or ordered in terms of best performance to poorest performance. The scale of measurement for a variable is a __ratio scale__ if the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful. Variables such as distance, height, weight, and time use the ratio scale of measurement. This scale requires that a zero value be included to indicate that nothing exists for the variable at the zero point.


### Categorical and Quantitative Data

For purposes of statistical analysis, data can be classified as categorical or quantitative. Categorical data use labels or names to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical data use either the nominal or ordinal scale of measurement and may be nonnumeric or numeric. Quantitative data are numeric values that indicate how much or how many. Quan- titative data use either the interval or ratio scale of measurement. Ordinary arithmetic op- erations are meaningful only if the data are quantitative. Therefore, statistical computations used for quantitative data are not always appropriate for categorical data.

Data can be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Data that can be grouped by specific categories are referred to as categorical data. Categorical data use either the nom- inal or ordinal scale of measurement. Data that use numeric values to indicate how much or how many are referred to as quantitative data. Quantitative data are obtained using either the interval or ratio scale of measurement.

A categorical variable is a variable with categorical data, and a quantitative variable is a variable with quantitative data. The statistical analysis appropriate for a particular vari- able depends upon whether the variable is categorical or quantitative. If the variable is categorical, the statistical analysis is limited. We can summarize categorical data by count- ing the number of observations in each category or by computing the proportion of the observations in each category. However, even when the categorical data are identified by a numerical code, arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division do not provide meaningful results. 

Data consist of the facts and figures that are collected and analyzed. Four scales of measurement used to obtain data on a particular variable include nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. The scale of measurement for a variable is nominal when the data are labels or names used to identify an attribute of an element. The scale is ordinal if the data demon- strate the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. The scale is interval if the data demonstrate the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Finally, the scale of measurement is ratio if the data show all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful.

### Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data

For purposes of statistical analysis, distinguishing between __cross-sectional data__ and __time series data__ is important. Cross-sectional data are data collected at the same or approxi- mately the same point in time.

### Descriptive Statistics

Most of the statistical information in newspapers, magazines, company reports, and other publications consists of data that are summarized and presented in a form that is easy for the reader to understand. Such summaries of data, which may be tabular, graphical, or numerical, are referred to as descriptive statistics.

### Statistical inference 

Many situations require information about a large group of elements (individuals, companies, voters, households, products, customers, and so on). But, because of time, cost, and other considerations, data can be collected from only a small portion of the group. The larger group of elements in a particular study is called the population, and the smaller group is called the sample. Formally, we use the following definitions:

* POPULATION : A population is the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.
* SAMPLE : A sample is a subset of the population.

The process of conducting a survey to collect data for the entire population is called a census. The process of conducting a survey to collect data for a sample is called a sample survey. As one of its major contributions, statistics uses data from a sample to make estimates and test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population through a process referred to as statistical inference.

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

### Data Mining

The term data warehousing is used to refer to the process of capturing, storing, and maintaining the data. Computing power and data collection tools have reached the point where it is now feasible to store and retrieve extremely large quantities of data in seconds. Analysis of the data in the warehouse may result in decisions that will lead to new strate- gies and higher profits for the organization.

The subject of __data mining__ deals with methods for developing useful decision-making information from large data bases. Using a combination of procedures from statistics, math- ematics, and computer science, analysts “mine the data” in the warehouse to convert it into useful information, hence the name data mining. Dr. Kurt Thearling, a leading practitioner in the field, defines data mining as “the automated extraction of predictive information from (large) databases.” The two key words in Dr. Thearling’s definition are “automated” and “predictive.” Data mining systems that are the most effective use automated procedures to extract information from the data using only the most general or even vague queries by the user. And data mining software automates the process of uncovering hidden predictive in- formation that in the past required hands-on analysis.

## 3.1 Measures of Location

Perhaps the most important measure of location is the mean, or average value, for a variable. The mean provides a measure of central location for the data. If the data are for a sample, the mean is denoted by ```x ̄```; if the data are for a population, the mean is denoted by the Greek letter ```μ```.

In statistical formulas, it is customary to denote the value of variable x for the first ob- servation by x<sub>1</sub>, the value of variable x for the second observation by x<sub>2</sub>, and so on. In gen- eral, the value of variable x for the ith observation is denoted by x<sub>i</sub>. For a sample with n observations, the formula for the sample mean is as follows.

$\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i$
