The main difference between a population and sample has to do with how observations are assigned to the data set.

* A population includes all of the elements from a set of data.  
* A sample consists one or more observations drawn from the population.  

Depending on the sampling method, a sample can have fewer observations than the population, the same number of observations, or more observations. More than one sample can be derived from the same population.

Other differences have to do with nomenclature, notation, and computations. For example,

* A measurable characteristic of a population, such as a mean or standard deviation, is called a parameter; but a measurable characteristic of a sample is called a statistic.  
* We will see in future lessons that the mean of a population is denoted by the symbol Î¼; but the mean of a sample is denoted by the symbol x.  
* We will also learn in future lessons that the formula for the standard deviation of a population is different from the formula for the standard deviation of a sample.
