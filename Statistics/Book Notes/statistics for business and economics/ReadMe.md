# Chapter 01 Data and Statistics

Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data. Nearly every college student majoring in business or economics is required to take a course in statistics.

### Scales of Measurement

Data collection requires one of the following scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. The scale of measurement determines the amount of information contained in the data and indicates the most appropriate data summarization and statistical analyses.

When the data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify an attribute of the element, the scale of measurement is considered a __nominal scale__. The scale of measurement for a variable is called an __ordinal scale__ if the data exhibit the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. The scale of measurement for a variable is an __interval scale__ if the data have all the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Interval data are always numeric. Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores are an example of interval-scaled data. For example, three students with SAT math scores of 620, 550, and 470 can be ranked or ordered in terms of best performance to poorest performance. The scale of measurement for a variable is a __ratio scale__ if the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful. Variables such as distance, height, weight, and time use the ratio scale of measurement. This scale requires that a zero value be included to indicate that nothing exists for the variable at the zero point.


### Categorical and Quantitative Data

For purposes of statistical analysis, data can be classified as categorical or quantitative. Categorical data use labels or names to identify an attribute of each element. Categorical data use either the nominal or ordinal scale of measurement and may be nonnumeric or numeric. Quantitative data are numeric values that indicate how much or how many. Quan- titative data use either the interval or ratio scale of measurement. Ordinary arithmetic op- erations are meaningful only if the data are quantitative. Therefore, statistical computations used for quantitative data are not always appropriate for categorical data.

Data can be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Data that can be grouped by specific categories are referred to as categorical data. Categorical data use either the nom- inal or ordinal scale of measurement. Data that use numeric values to indicate how much or how many are referred to as quantitative data. Quantitative data are obtained using either the interval or ratio scale of measurement.

A categorical variable is a variable with categorical data, and a quantitative variable is a variable with quantitative data. The statistical analysis appropriate for a particular vari- able depends upon whether the variable is categorical or quantitative. If the variable is categorical, the statistical analysis is limited. We can summarize categorical data by count- ing the number of observations in each category or by computing the proportion of the observations in each category. However, even when the categorical data are identified by a numerical code, arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division do not provide meaningful results. 

Data consist of the facts and figures that are collected and analyzed. Four scales of measurement used to obtain data on a particular variable include nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. The scale of measurement for a variable is nominal when the data are labels or names used to identify an attribute of an element. The scale is ordinal if the data demon- strate the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful. The scale is interval if the data demonstrate the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Finally, the scale of measurement is ratio if the data show all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful.

### Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data

For purposes of statistical analysis, distinguishing between __cross-sectional data__ and __time series data__ is important. Cross-sectional data are data collected at the same or approxi- mately the same point in time.

### Descriptive Statistics

Most of the statistical information in newspapers, magazines, company reports, and other publications consists of data that are summarized and presented in a form that is easy for the reader to understand. Such summaries of data, which may be tabular, graphical, or numerical, are referred to as descriptive statistics.

### Statistical inference 

Many situations require information about a large group of elements (individuals, companies, voters, households, products, customers, and so on). But, because of time, cost, and other considerations, data can be collected from only a small portion of the group. The larger group of elements in a particular study is called the population, and the smaller group is called the sample. Formally, we use the following definitions:

* POPULATION : A population is the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.
* SAMPLE : A sample is a subset of the population.

The process of conducting a survey to collect data for the entire population is called a census. The process of conducting a survey to collect data for a sample is called a sample survey. As one of its major contributions, statistics uses data from a sample to make estimates and test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population through a process referred to as statistical inference.

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

### Data Mining

The term data warehousing is used to refer to the process of capturing, storing, and maintaining the data. Computing power and data collection tools have reached the point where it is now feasible to store and retrieve extremely large quantities of data in seconds. Analysis of the data in the warehouse may result in decisions that will lead to new strate- gies and higher profits for the organization.

The subject of __data mining__ deals with methods for developing useful decision-making information from large data bases. Using a combination of procedures from statistics, math- ematics, and computer science, analysts “mine the data” in the warehouse to convert it into useful information, hence the name data mining. Dr. Kurt Thearling, a leading practitioner in the field, defines data mining as “the automated extraction of predictive information from (large) databases.” The two key words in Dr. Thearling’s definition are “automated” and “predictive.” Data mining systems that are the most effective use automated procedures to extract information from the data using only the most general or even vague queries by the user. And data mining software automates the process of uncovering hidden predictive in- formation that in the past required hands-on analysis.

## 3.1 Measures of Location

> a measure of location, or central tendency, such as the arithmetic mean:	A fundamental task in many statistical analyses is to estimate a location parameter for the distribution; i.e., to find a typical or central value that best describes the data.

#### Mean

Perhaps the most important measure of location is the mean, or average value, for a variable. The mean provides a measure of central location for the data. If the data are for a sample, the mean is denoted by ```x ̄```; if the data are for a population, the mean is denoted by the Greek letter ```μ```.

In statistical formulas, it is customary to denote the value of variable x for the first ob- servation by x<sub>1</sub>, the value of variable x for the second observation by x<sub>2</sub>, and so on. In gen- eral, the value of variable x for the ith observation is denoted by x<sub>i</sub>. For a sample with n observations, the formula for the sample mean is as follows.

The formula for computing the mean of a population remains the same, but we use different notation to indicate that we are working with the entire population. The number of observations in a population is denoted by N and the symbol for a population mean is ```μ```.

#### Median

The median is another measure of central location. The median is the value in the middle when the data are arranged in ascending order (smallest value to largest value). With an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. An even number of observations has no single middle value. In this case, we follow convention and define the median as the average of the values for the middle two observations. For convenience the definition of the median is restated as follows.

Arrange the data in ascending order (smallest value to largest value).

* For an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value.
* For an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Although the mean is the more commonly used measure of central location, in some situations the median is preferred. The mean is influenced by extremely small and large data values. We can generalize to say that whenever a data set contains extreme values, the median is often the preferred measure of central location.

#### Mode

> Mode : The mode is the value that occurs with greatest frequency.

Situations can arise for which the greatest frequency occurs at two or more different values. In these instances more than one mode exists. If the data contain exactly two modes, we say that the data are bimodal. If data contain more than two modes, we say that the data are multimodal. In multimodal cases the mode is almost never reported because listing three or more modes would not be particularly helpful in describing a location for the data.


#### Percentiles

A percentile provides information about how the data are spread over the interval from the smallest value to the largest value. For data that do not contain numerous repeated values, the pth percentile divides the data into two parts. Approximately p percent of the observa- tions have values less than the pth percentile; approximately (100 - p) percent of the ob- servations have values greater than the pth percentile. The pth percentile is formally defined as follows.

> PERCENTILE : The pth percentile is a value such that at least p percent of the observations are less than or equal to this value and at least (100 􏰁 p) percent of the observations are greater than or equal to this value.

#### Quartiles

It is often desirable to divide data into four parts, with each part containing approximately one-fourth, or 25% of the observations. The division points are referred to as the quartiles and are defined as

```
Q1 : first quartile, or 25th percentile
Q2 : second quartile, or 50th percentile (also the median) 
Q3 : third quartile, or 75th percentile
```

## 3.2 Measures of Variability

#### Range

The simplest measure of variability is the range : ```Range = Largest value - Smallest value```.

#### Interquartile Range

A measure of variability that overcomes the dependency on extreme values is the inter- quartile range (IQR). This measure of variability is the difference between the third quar- tile, Q3, and the first quartile, Q1. In other words, the interquartile range is the range for the middle 50% of the data. ```INTERQUARTILE RANGE
IQR = Q3 - Q1```.

#### Variance

The variance is a measure of variability that utilizes all the data. The variance is based on the difference between the value of each observation (x<sub>i</sub> ) and the mean. The difference between each x<sub>i</sub>  and the mean (x ̄ for a sample, μ for a population) is called a deviation about the mean. For a sample, a deviation about the mean is written (x<sub>i</sub>  - x ̄ ); for a population, it is written (x<sub>i</sub> - μ). In the computation of the variance, the deviations about the mean are squared.


If the data are for a population, the average of the squared deviations is called the population variance. The population variance is denoted by the Greek symbol σ<sup>2</sup>. For a population of N observations and with μ denoting the population mean, the definition of the population variance is as follows.

In most statistical applications, the data being analyzed are for a sample. When we compute a sample variance, we are often interested in using it to estimate the population variance σ<sup>2</sup>. Although a detailed explanation is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown that if the sum of the squared deviations about the sample mean is divided by n - 1, and not n, the resulting sample variance provides an unbiased estimate of the population variance. For this reason, the sample variance, denoted by s<sup>2</sup>, is defined as follows.

#### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is defined to be the positive square root of the variance. Following the notation we adopted for a sample variance and a population variance, we use s to denote the sample standard deviation and σ to denote the population standard deviation. The standard deviation is derived from the variance in the following way.
