### Standard error of a sampling distribution

The values in any population deviate from their mean (people have different heights, and so on). __Variability in a population of individuals is measured in standard deviations__. Sample means vary because you’re not sampling the whole population, only a subset. __Variability in the sample mean is measured in terms of standard errors__.

Error here doesn’t mean there’s been a mistake — it means there is a gap between the population and sample results.



### Standard Deviation v Standard Error vs Standard Error of the Mean

Variability in sample statistics is measured in __standard errors__. A standard error is very similar to the __standard deviation__ of a data set or a population. The difference is that a standard error measures the variation among all the possible values of the statistic (for example all the possible sample means) while a standard deviation of a population measures the variation among all possible values within the population itself.
