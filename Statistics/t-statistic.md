https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-statistic  

In statistics, the t-statistic is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. For example, it is used in estimating the population mean from a sampling distribution of sample means if the population standard deviation is unknown.
