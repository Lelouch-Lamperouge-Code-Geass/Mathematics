The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that the poll's reported results are close to the "true" figures; that is, the figures for the whole population. Margin of error is positive whenever a population is incompletely sampled and the outcome measure has positive variance (that is, it varies).

The term "margin of error" is often used in non-survey contexts to indicate observational error in reporting measured quantities.

### Making Your Best Guesstimate

A confidence interval (abbreviated CI) is used for the purpose of estimating a population parameter (a single number that describes a population) by using statistics (numbers that describe a sample of data). For example, you might estimate the average household income (parameter) based on the average household income from a random sample of 1,000 homes (statis- tic). However, because sample results will vary (see Chapter 6) you need to add a measure of that variability to your estimate. This measure of variability is called the margin of error, the heart of a confidence interval. Your sample statistic, plus or minus your margin of error, gives you a range of likely values for the parameter — in other words, a confidence interval.

The margin of error is the amount of “plus or minus” that is attached to your sample result when you move from discuss- ing the sample itself to discussing the whole population that it represents; that’s why the general formula for the margin of error contains a “±” in front of it.

For example, say the percentage of kids who like baseball is 40 percent, plus or minus 3.5 percent. That means the per- centage of kids who like baseball is somewhere between 40% - 3.5% = 36.5% and 40% + 3.5% = 43.5%. The lower end of the interval is your statistic minus the margin of error, and the upper end is your statistic plus the margin of error.

> The margin of error is not the chance a mistake was made; it measures variation in the random samples due to chance. Because you didn’t get to sample everybody in the popula- tion, you expect your sample results to be “off” by a certain amount, just by chance. You acknowledge that your results could change with subsequent samples, and that they’re only accurate to within a certain range, which is the margin of error.

### The Goal: Small Margin of Error

The ultimate goal when making an estimate using a confidence interval is to have a small margin of error. The narrower the interval, the more precise the results are.

For example, suppose you’re trying to estimate the percent- age of semi trucks on the interstate between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m., and you come up with a 95% confidence inter- val that claims the percentage of semis is 50%, plus or minus 40%. Wow, that narrows it down! (Not.) You’ve defeated the purpose of trying to come up with a good estimate — the con- fidence interval is much too wide. You’d rather say something like: A 95% confidence interval for the percentage of semis
on the interstate between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. is 50%, plus or minus 3% (thus between 47% and 53%).

How do you go about ensuring that your confidence interval will be narrow enough? You certainly want to think about this issue before collecting your data; after the data are collected, the width of the confidence interval is set.
Three factors affect the size of the margin of error:

* The confidence level  
* The sample size  
* The amount of variability in the population  


These three factors all play important roles in influencing the width of a confidence interval. In the following sections, you see how.

Note that the sample statistic itself (for example, 50% of vehicles in the sample are semis) isn’t related to the width of the confidence interval. The statistic only determines the mid- point of the confidence interval, not its width.
