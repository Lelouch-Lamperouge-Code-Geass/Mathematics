* A cross-sectional dataset is one where all data is treated as being at one point in time. Let's say you have a dataset of salaries across a city - they have all been gathered at one point in time and thus we refer to the data as cross-sectional.  
* A time series dataset is one where the observations are time dependent. For instance, let us now suppose that a researcher collects salary data across a city on a month-by-month basis. The observations in the dataset will now differ across time.  
* Pooled (or panel) data is where the two are combined together. i.e. a salary dataset can contain observations collected at one point in time, as well as across different time periods.
