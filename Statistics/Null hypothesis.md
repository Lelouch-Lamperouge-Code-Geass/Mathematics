零假设（null hypothesis），统计学术语，又称原假设，指进行统计检验时预先建立的假设。 零假设成立时，有关统计量应服从已知的某种概率分布。
当统计量的计算值落入否定域时，可知发生了小概率事件，应否定原假设。

在统计学中，零假设（虚无假设）是做统计检验时的一类假设。零假设的内容一般是希望证明其错误的假设。比如说，在相关性检验中，一般会取“两者之间没有关联”作为零假设，而在独立性检验中，一般会取“两者之间有关联”作为零假设。与零假设相对的是备择假设（对立假设），即不希望看到的另一种可能。从数学上来看，零假设和备择假设的地位是相等的，但是在统计学的实际运用中，常常需要强调一类假设为应当或期望实现的假设。如果一个统计检验的结果拒绝零假设（结论不支持零假设），而实际上真实的情况属于零假设，那么称这个检验犯了第一类错误。反之，如果检验结果支持零假设，而实际上真实的情况属于备择假设，那么称这个检验犯了第二类错误。通常的做法是，在保持第一类错误出现的机会在某个特定水平上的时候，尽量减少第二类错误出现的概率.

### What is a 'Null Hypothesis'

A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations. The null hypothesis attempts to show that no variation exists between variables or that a single variable is no different than its mean. It is presumed to be true until statistical evidence nullifies it for an alternative hypothesis.

The null hypothesis, also known as the conjecture, assumes that any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance. The opposite of the null hypothesis is known as the alternative hypothesis.

### Null Hypothesis Versus Alternative Hypothesis 

The null hypothesis is the initial statistical claim that the population mean is equivalent to the claimed. For example, assume the average time to cook a specific brand of pasta is 12 minutes. Therefore, the null hypothesis would be stated as, "The population mean is equal to 12 minutes." Conversely, the alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected.

For example, assume the hypothesis test is set up so that the alternative hypothesis states that the population parameter is not equal to the claimed value. Therefore, the cook time for the population mean is not equal to 12 minutes; rather, it could be less than or greater than the stated value. If the null hypothesis is accepted or the statistical test indicates that the population mean is 12 minutes, then the alternative hypothesis is rejected. And vice versa.

### Hypothesis Testing for Investments

For example, Alice sees that her investment strategy produces higher average returns than simply buying and holding a stock. The null hypothesis claims that there is no difference between the two average returns, and Alice has to believe this until she proves otherwise. Refuting the null hypothesis would require showing statistical significance, which can be found using a variety of tests. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis would state that the investment strategy has a higher average return than a traditional buy-and-hold strategy.

The p-value is used to determine the statistical significance of the results. A p-value that is less than or equal to 0.05 is usually used to indicate whether there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis. If Alice conducts one of these tests, such as a test using the normal model, and proves that the difference between her returns and the buy-and-hold returns is significant, or the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, she can then refute the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
