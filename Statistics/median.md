The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it.

The median is a commonly used measure of the properties of a data set in statistics and probability theory. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the "average") is that it is not skewed so much by extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a "typical" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets which vary greatly, a mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a "typical" income is.

Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result.

* 中位数的优点:中位数很好地代表了一组观察值的中点，特别是当直方图显示出这是一个偏斜分布时。 中位数只需要很少量的计算。 只需将所有的观察值从小到大排序，就可应用 找中点的方法得到中位数。中位数对极端值不敏感，在某些情况下这将是一种优点 。    
* 中位数的缺点:除 了中间值，中位数并未利用其它观察值 。 这样它就没有利用触据中的 所有信息 。 中位数对极端值不敏感，这在某些情况下是-种缺点 。
